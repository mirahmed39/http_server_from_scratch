    <p class="about-description">This is an about page. The about page is ssupposed to have a
        description of what is presented in the page. It lets us know more about the content
        we are interested in. In this case, this about page is about a fansite. This is a fansite
        that I created from scratch. And, by saying "from scratch", I mean like entirely from the base.
        which include creating a server just using the net module and and writing handling all the requests
        and responses with socket object. I am a GREAT fan of SOCKET object now. SOCKET ALL DAY!!! :p
